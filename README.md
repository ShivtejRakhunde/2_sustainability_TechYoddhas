Problem Statement: 
 "Smart Grid Optimization: Integrating Renewable Energy for Sustainable Power Systems"

Goals:
  1. To build predictive models capable of accurately forecasting power generation.
  2. Additionally, they'll assess grid stability. Thus, we have to divide the Power generated in Generation node in the ratio mentioned between the three nodes.

Problem Statement: 
  1) Considering the past 5 years of data provided, predict total power generated (p) for the first 3 months of 2024 at an hourly granularity. (Independent variables for first 3 
  months of 2024 for consideration is shared in a separate file.) 
  2) For above problem you need to merge all 20 files data as an final input file. Which will be consisting of Date time, Air, Pressure, wind speed and Power generated variables.
  3) Considering this total power generated (p), prepare a database such that the generated power is distributed to 3 different consumption nodes with Node 1 will be taking 20% of total power,Node 2 will be 
  taking 45% of total power and Node 3 will be taking 35% of total power generated respectively.
  4) Use this existing and the newly prepared dataset to determine the Stability (“stability”, Dependent Variable) of the power Grid.
  5) For above problem you need to consider Grid folder data consisting of price per unit, unit consumption, and grid stability report on hourly basis. Also, you need to add Power generated and stored at each Node(predicted during 3rd step.
